# Deep-Learning--Yolo-Model-of-Object-Detenction-in-train-video
🔍 Deep Learning – YOLO Model for Object Detection in Training Video
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model applied to training videos. The system processes video frames and detects multiple objects with bounding boxes and class labels in real time.

YOLO’s single-stage architecture ensures high speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-world video-based applications.

🚀 Features

🎯 Real-time object detection on video

🎥 Frame-by-frame video processing

🧠 YOLO deep learning model

⚡ Fast and accurate inference

📦 Multi-class object detection

🌐 Streamlit web application support
